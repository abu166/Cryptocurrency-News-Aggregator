# Cryptocurrency News Aggregator

## Overview
This project is a Rust-based command-line application that aggregates recent cryptocurrency news based on user input (cryptocurrency name or symbol, e.g., "Bitcoin" or "BTC"). It integrates with two data sources (CoinGecko and a mocked CoinMarketCap feed) to fetch and display news articles in a structured format, including title, source, date, summary, and link. The application was developed to meet the core requirements of a university assignment under a tight 10-minute deadline, prioritizing functionality and robustness over optional features.

## Features
- **User Input**: Accepts a cryptocurrency name or symbol via command-line input.
- **Multiple Data Sources**:
  - **CoinGecko**: Fetches news from CoinGecko's free /news API, filtering articles relevant to the input cryptocurrency.
  - **CoinMarketCap**: Provides a mocked news article (due to API key requirements for their news endpoint).
- **Structured Output**: Displays news articles with:
  - Title
  - Source
  - Date
  - Summary
  - Link
- **Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handles API failures, rate limits, and malformed responses.
  - Continues execution even if one source fails, ensuring partial results are shown.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple CLI for user interaction, displaying results in a readable format.

## Assignment Requirements Met
The project fulfills the core functional requirements of the assignment:

- **Search by Cryptocurrency**: Users input a name/symbol to retrieve news (e.g., "Bitcoin").
- **Multiple APIs**: Integrates CoinGecko (live API) and CoinMarketCap (mocked due to paid API access).
- **Structured Display**: Outputs news with title, source, date, summary, and link.
- **Error Handling**: Robustly manages API errors and rate limits, ensuring the program doesn't crash.
- **Minimal Interface**: Uses CLI instead of a web UI due to time constraints, but meets the display requirement.

## Limitations (Due to Deadline)
- **No Web Interface**: A web frontend (HTML/CSS or Yew) was not implemented due to the 10-minute deadline. The CLI suffices for user interaction.
- **Mocked CoinMarketCap**: CoinMarketCap's news API requires a paid key, so a sample article is mocked to simulate a second source.
- **No Caching**: Optional caching (Redis/SQLite/PostgreSQL) was skipped to prioritize core functionality.
- **No Bonus Features**: Authentication, sentiment analysis, and WebSocket updates were not implemented due to time.
- **CoinGecko Dependency**: Relies on CoinGecko's free API, which may have rate limits or response inconsistencies (handled gracefully).

```

## File Descriptions
- **Cargo.toml**: Defines project metadata and dependencies (reqwest, serde, tokio, thiserror).
- **src/main.rs**: Orchestrates the program flow—prompts for input, calls API functions, and displays results.
- **src/api.rs**: Contains functions to fetch news:
  - `fetch_coingecko_news`: Queries CoinGecko's API and filters by crypto name.
  - `fetch_coinmarketcap_news`: Returns a mocked article.
- **src/models.rs**: Defines the `NewsArticle` struct for serializing/deserializing news data.
- **src/error.rs**: Custom `AppError` enum for handling I/O, HTTP, and API errors.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rust with:
  - reqwest for HTTP requests
  - serde for JSON serialization
  - tokio for async runtime
  - thiserror for error handling
- **Frontend**: Command-line interface (no web UI due to time).
- **Data Sources**:
  - CoinGecko API (live)
  - CoinMarketCap (mocked)
- **No Storage**: Caching/database omitted.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Rust installed (rustc and cargo).
- Internet connection (for CoinGecko API).

### Steps
1. **Clone or Extract**:
   - Place the project folder (crypto_news_aggregator) on your system.
2. **Navigate to Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd crypto_news_aggregator
   ```
3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
5. **Interact**:
   - Enter a cryptocurrency name or symbol (e.g., "Bitcoin", "BTC").
   - View news articles from CoinGecko (if available) and CoinMarketCap (mocked).

## Example Output
```
Enter cryptocurrency name or symbol (e.g., Bitcoin, BTC):
Bitcoin

=== News for BITCOIN ===

CoinGecko News:
Title: Bitcoin Hits New High
Source: Some Source
Date: 2025-04-15
Summary: Bitcoin price surges...
Link: https://example.com

CoinMarketCap News:
Title: Sample News for Bitcoin
Source: CoinMarketCap
Date: 2025-04-15
Summary: This is a mocked article due to API key requirement.
Link: https://coinmarketcap.com
```

If CoinGecko fails (e.g., rate limit or API issue):

```
Enter cryptocurrency name or symbol (e.g., Bitcoin, BTC):
Bitcoin
No 'data' array in CoinGecko response

=== News for BITCOIN ===

CoinGecko News:
<empty>

CoinMarketCap News:
Title: Sample News for Bitcoin
Source: CoinMarketCap
Date: 2025-04-15
Summary: This is a mocked article due to API key requirement.
Link: https://coinmarketcap.com
```

## Error Handling
- **CoinGecko Failures**: If the API is down or returns unexpected data, the program logs the issue and returns empty results for that source, continuing with CoinMarketCap.
- **Rate Limits**: CoinGecko allows ~100 requests/min, sufficient for testing. Handled by returning empty results if throttled.
- **Input Errors**: Invalid inputs are normalized (trimmed, lowercased) for consistent filtering.
- **Mocked Source**: CoinMarketCap's mock ensures at least one source always "works."

## Notes for Improvement
Given more time, the following could enhance the project:

- **Web UI**: Implement with Yew or HTML/CSS for browser-based interaction.
- **Real CoinMarketCap API**: Integrate with a paid API key for live news.
- **Caching**: Use Redis or SQLite to store recent API responses, reducing calls.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - Sentiment analysis of articles using NLP libraries.
  - WebSocket for real-time news updates.
  - API key management for secure access.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for API parsing and error cases.

## Conclusion
This project delivers a functional cryptocurrency news aggregator tailored to the assignment's core requirements under severe time constraints. It demonstrates Rust's capabilities for async API calls, error handling, and structured data processing. Despite limitations (CLI, mocked source), it provides a working solution that fetches and displays news reliably.
